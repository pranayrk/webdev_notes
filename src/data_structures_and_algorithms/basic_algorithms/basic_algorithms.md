### Basic Algorithms
* Selections — Kth Smallest Elements (Sort, QuickSelect, Mediums of Mediums) — Implement all three ways
* Permutations
* Subsets
* BFS Graph
* DFS Graph
* Dijkstra’s Algorithm (just learn the idea — no need to implement)
---
### Basic Algorithms
* Tree Traversals — BFS, DFS (in-order, pre-order, post-order): Implement Recursive and Iterative
* External Sort — No implementation; Just know the concept.
* NP-Complete (Video) — Just know the concept
* Topological Sort
* Detect cycle in an undirected graph

---
### Basic Algorithms
* Implement a HashTable with simple Hashing functions
* Implement a Graph using Adjacency List, and then write functions for BFS & DFS.
* Write the binary search algorithm both recursively and iteratively
* Write the merge sort algorithm
* Write the quicksort algorithm
* Print binary tree using DFS (in-order, preorder and post order — all three of them) and BFS.
